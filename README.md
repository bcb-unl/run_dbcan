## NOTICE

A current test version by Xinpeng. Need to be approved by haidong and then could be merged to main branch (code folder: dbcan_test).

## Introduction

**Notice**

This is the updated version of run_dbcan. There are many changes compared to the old version, and the relevant REPO address has been moved to bcb-unl (new organization). We will try our best to keep the two versions updated synchronously.

**run_dbcan** is the standalone version of the [dbCAN3](http://bcb.unl.edu/dbCAN2/) annotation tool for automated CAZyme annotation. This tool, known as `run_dbcan`, incorporates HMMER, Diamond, and dbCAN_sub for annotating CAZyme families, and integrates Cazyme Gene Clusters (CGCs) and substrate predictions.

For usage discussions, visit our [issue tracker](https://github.com/bcb-unl/run_dbcan_new/issues). To learn more, read the [dbcan doc]. If you're interested in contributing, whether through issues or pull requests, please review our contribution guide.
